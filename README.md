Geospatial manipulations of IBGE shapefiles to fulfill some regional healthcare network (RRAS in portuguese) research demmands. Written in R. 

Objectives
----------

Write down scripts to:

* Build a data dir with useful shapefiles scattered over gov't sites;
* Manipulate those files to construct derived ones covering politically defined subsets of cities. E. g. healthcare regions;
* Calculate some basic descriptive statistics with a geospatial touch using DATASUS stuff.
